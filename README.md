# Statistical Machine Learning 📊🧠

This repository contains assignment submissions and practical implementations from the **STAT30270: Statistical Machine Learning** module at **University College Dublin (UCD)**. The work is entirely done using **R**, applying supervised learning methods on real-world datasets.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Model Tuning with `caret`
- Classification Accuracy & Cross-validation
- Real-world application on the **ProcessMiner dataset**


 Implements logistic regression with multiple predictors on a binary classification dataset 
 Applies SVM with linear and radial kernels; includes visualization and hyperparameter tuning 
 Compares multiple classifiers using the `caret` package with cross-validation 
 Builds and compares deep learning models (DNN, CNN, CNN+LSTM) on activity classification using sensor data 

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- R
- `caret`, `e1071`, `nnet`, `keras`, `ggplot2`
- Jupyter and RMarkdown for documentation and visualization

---

## ✅ Key Highlights

- Built and evaluated classification models using real-world sensor data.
- Used stratified cross-validation and confusion matrices for model assessment.
- Applied SVMs and logistic regression with tuning of kernel and cost parameters.
- Demonstrated ability to use `caret` and `keras` in R for advanced ML modeling.

## 📌 How to Use

To run any of the `.Rmd` files:
1. Open in RStudio.
2. Knit the file or run chunks sequentially.
3. Ensure required packages (e.g., `e1071`, `caret`, `keras`) are installed.
